### About me

My name is Dillon Dow and I am an enthusiastic developer with two years of experience in a fast-paced start-up environment. Most of my experience is with React-Native, React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. The work I have done for my job as a full stack web developer at NextStep HealthTech is in private repositories, but I would be happy to discuss my experience and knowledge.

### ðŸ”­Project that I am currently working on:  PastStats
-   An app that allows you to check the stats of a basketball game at a specific time in the game. It's always been super inconvienient to me that I couldn't check stats of the Celtics game if I wasnt watching the game live. I decided I would make PastStats as a side project to help solve that issue.
-   mobile app: React-Native
-   web app: React
-   server: node.js and express
-   database: DynamoDB
